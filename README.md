# Data-Science-With-Python
This repository contains my coursework from the Python For Data Science course (MSDS 430) at Northwestern University. 
This course covers an array of introductory Python concepts that are useful for data scientists including working with the Pandas module, defining custom functions and classes, data visualization, text analytics, and image processing.
